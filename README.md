## Knope Compliments

An exercise in learning how to develop for iOS in my first xCode program.

The idea is to generate compliments like the ones that Leslie Knope gives to her best friend, Ann Perkins in the NBC comedy *Parks and Recreation*.

Some examples:

- You beautiful, tropical land-mermaid.
- You tricky minx!
- You perfect sunflower!

...and other awesome compliments to give you a quick pick-me-up.
